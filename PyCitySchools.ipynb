    "* Charter schools performed better across all metrics when compared to district schools. However, the average number of students per charter schools is approximately 60% less than the average number of students per district schools. Additional analysis is required to determine school practices given the much lower average student population per charter school.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall, schools with lower per-student budgets performed better than schools with higher per-student budgets. Additionally, schools with small to medium populations (up to 2,500) performed better than schools with large populations. Considering though that charter schools have, on average, smaller student populations, further analysis is needed to determine if these results are skewed."
